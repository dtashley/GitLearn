## Outline

Here is the outline from AS, which I've pasted in here (it was originally
in a separate file, which AS inexplicably deleted):

Still fighting with my editor problem. Creating a change to commit and test.

Adding this line to see if I can push this from the command line using my brand new SSH key

These are a few of the things that come to mind. They are not necessarily
meant to be a chapter each, just a rough timeline / outline for the whole
thing.  Please fee free to expand, amend and delete anything in here as
you see fit.

## DTA's Further Ramblings About *Git* and *GitHub*

You (AS) should be aware that this file, signaled by
the *.md* extension, is interpreted by the server,
and processed by the server before it is served
out.  So, you can put all kinds of goodies in the
file (*GitHub Markdown*) that lead to something that
looks nice.  The server translates this markdown into HTML.

This link might be a good starting point:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

And lists:

1. Feed the cats.
1. Double-check that the cats have been fed.
1. Examine my life to see if there is any additional thing I can do
to make the cats happier.

You might also look up the *Atom* editor.  I understand there
is a version for the *Mac*, too.  It will let you view the result
of markdown without having to push it to the server first.

The image below shows *Atom* displaying the source text and the
likely view produced by the server, side by side.  Changing
the text of the left updates the instant preview on the right.
