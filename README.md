# GitLearn
Repository to experiment with Git and collaboration.

This is a sample change, to add something to the file that
shows up in a difference report.

So I've cloned this again and am trying out GitHub Desktop

Still fighting with my editor problem. Creating a change to commit and test

Adding this line to see if I can push this from the command line using my brand new SSH key

I actually opened this in Terminal to make a commit on the test01 branch.

And now I have fixed the typo in the previous sentence.
